# Vulnerability-Detection-and-Correction-Tool

This project implements a robust approach for detecting and correcting vulnerabilities in software code using deep learning techniques. We employ a binary classification model to categorize code snippets as either 'bug' or 'no bug'. Our methodology involves a comparative analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Bidirectional LSTMs (Bi-LSTMs).

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Comment Removal: We meticulously cleaned our dataset by removing comments and extraneous elements to focus on the syntactical and structural patterns indicative of vulnerabilities.
Label Transformation: Labels were standardized to 'positive' for bug-positive instances and 'negative' for no-bug instances, aligning with our binary classification framework.
Handling Various Data Sources: Managed datasets from diverse sources including gz files, MySQL databases, etc., ensuring data quality and relevance.

2. Model Development
Frameworks: Utilized TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development and training, leveraging their robust functionalities for handling complex neural network architectures.
Models: Implemented CNNs, LSTMs, and Bi-LSTMs, comparing their performance in vulnerability detection.

3. Vulnerability Correction
LLMs Fine-Tuning: We fine-tuned modern Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-2, T5, and BERT for vulnerability correction.
GPT-2: Outperformed T5 and BERT in providing accurate code corrections, despite requiring longer training times.
T5: Showed moderate performance.
BERT: Tended to overfit the data.
Focus on Specific Vulnerabilities: Detected and corrected vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in web applications.
